## 0.1.11 (2013-07-11)

* Online: Added support for `Class` read/write
* Fixed broken collection resource for Online#Item
* Implemented ItemSpec from @thilo - thank you
  Online resource for collection generation is now just the plural name
  of the model across the board - it appears Intuit has standardized on
  this going forward and we no longer need the overrides in certain
  models
* Added ServerTime accessor to AccessToken entity

## 0.1.10 (2013-06-06)

* Desktop: Begin implementation of enforcing filter ordering. The Intuit API requires that filter elements obey a given order. We don't expect callers to know this order. Thus, callers can give us an array of filters and the Service class will re-order them appropriately. As of this release only `Job` service has `FILTER_ORDER` defined. However going forward its easy to add it to other Service objects as needed.

## 0.1.9 (2013-06-04)

* Added Address convenience assignment methods to Online Customer model.

## 0.1.4 (2013-03-24)

* Refactored `Filter` and separated the handling of `Date` and `DateTime`. Also refactored how operational XML is generated and removed hard-coded XML scattered in classes in favor of a centralized mechanism for generating generic XML.

## 0.1.2 (2013-01-18)

* Fixed issue where an instance of `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` was given to a `:datetime` Filter and the resultant format was not being correctly parsed by Intuit.

## 0.1.1 (2013-01-16)

* Quickeebooks can now re-authorize a token via `Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::AccessToken.reconnect`. In addition destroying an access token can now be done via `Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::AccessToken.disconnect`. Thank you to `FundingGates` for the contribution.

## 0.1.0 (2013-01-16)

* Quickbooks Online now supports a single HTTP endpoint for API calls, no need to first determine the Base URL. `Quickeebooks::Online::ServiceBase` has been adjusted to use a single API endpoint.
